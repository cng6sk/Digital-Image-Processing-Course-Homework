## Digital Image Processing Course Project

This repository contains the project work for the Digital Image Processing course, focusing on the practical implementation of various dehazing algorithms.

## Project Overview

The project includes the implementation of three different dehazing algorithms:
1. **Dark Channel Prior (DCP)** - Implemented in `baseline.py`.
2. **Color Attenuation Prior (CAP)** - Implemented in `CAP.py`.
3. **Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR)** - Implemented in `MSRCR.py`.

## File Descriptions

- `baseline.py`: Contains the implementation of the Dark Channel Prior (DCP) dehazing algorithm.
- `CAP.py`: Contains the implementation of the Color Attenuation Prior (CAP) dehazing algorithm.
- `MSRCR.py`: Contains the implementation of the Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) dehazing algorithm.
- `dehaze_metrics.py`: Script for evaluating the performance metrics of the dehazing algorithms.
- `combine.py` and `visual_effect.py`: Scripts for generating visual effects of the dehazed images.
- `./dataset/real_world`: Directory containing real-world foggy images collected for testing.


## Dataset

The `./dataset/real_world` directory contains real-world foggy images that were collected for testing the dehazing algorithms.
